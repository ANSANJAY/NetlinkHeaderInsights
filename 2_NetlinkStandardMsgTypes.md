**Netlink Message Header & Types**

---

### 📝 **Recap on Netlink Message Header**

- The Netlink message header format has been discussed previously.
- The header plays a pivotal role in structuring the Netlink message and its communication.

### 🖼 **Visualization of Netlink Message Header**

- The diagram primarily focuses on the Netlink message header.
- The **Netlink message header length** specifies the total size of the complete Netlink message:
  - Includes the header itself
  - The associated padding
  - The payload it carries

### 📌 **Netlink Message Types**

- The `user include Linux Netlink.h` file defines four standard **Netlink message header types** crucial for kernel space Netlink dealings.
  1. **Netlink message No operation** (Value: 1) - Essentially a Netlink "ping." It verifies the communication partner's presence.
  2. **Netlink message Error** (Value: 2) - Indicates an inability to perform the requested action. 
  3. **Netlink message Done** (Value: 3) - Marks the end in a series of cascaded Netlink messages. Also serves as an acknowledgment.
  4. **Netlink message Overrun** (Value: 4) - Not actively used in the Linux kernel as per current documentation.

### 🔎 **Exploring the `Netlink.h` Header File**

- The header file contains definitions for the Netlink message structure and its types.
- While there are standard Netlink message types defined, developers can introduce their own.
- When creating custom Netlink message types, their values must be **≥ 16**. Values below 16 are reserved for other kernel uses.

**📜 Interview Questions on Netlink Message Header & Types**

1. **Q:** What does the **Netlink message header length** represent?  
   **A:** It signifies the total size of the entire Netlink message, which includes the header, the padding, and the payload.

2. **Q:** How many standard Netlink message types are defined, and what are they?  
   **A:** There are four standard Netlink message types: No operation, Error, Done, and Overrun.

3. **Q:** What is the primary role of the **Netlink message No operation**?  
   **A:** It acts as a "ping" to verify if the other communication partner (kernel space or user space) is active and responsive.

4. **Q:** When is the **Netlink message Error** type used?  
   **A:** This message type is used to indicate that the other party couldn't execute a previously requested action.

5. **Q:** Explain the use of **Netlink message Done**.  
   **A:** It serves two main purposes: to mark the end in a series of cascaded Netlink messages and to act as an acknowledgment for a completed request.

6. **Q:** Can developers define their own Netlink message types?  
   **A:** Yes, developers can create custom Netlink message types. However, they must ensure that the values for these types are 16 or higher since values below 16 are reserved for other kernel functions.
